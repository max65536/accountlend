# AccountLend Development Progress

## Project Overview
A Session Key Marketplace built on Starknet that allows users to lend and rent temporary account access through session keys. The project implements Starknet's native Account Abstraction (AA) using Argent's session key implementation.

**Demo**: https://accountlend.vercel.app/
**Repository**: https://github.com/max65536/accountlend

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Blockchain**: Starknet.js + @starknet-react/core v2.0.0
- **Session Keys**: @argent/x-sessions v6.3.1
- **Wallets**: Argent & Braavos via starknetkit
- **Smart Contracts**: Cairo (Scarb)
- **Styling**: PicoCSS

## Current Issues & Blockers

### Critical Issues
1. **Missing Smart Contracts**: Only placeholder Fibonacci function exists
2. **Incomplete Session Integration**: @argent/x-sessions not fully implemented
3. **No Contract Deployment**: No evidence of deployed contracts on Starknet

### Technical Debt
1. **Hardcoded Values**: Mock data instead of blockchain state
2. **Commented Code**: Key functionality disabled in tasksend.tsx
3. **Error Handling**: Limited error handling throughout the app
4. **Type Safety**: Some TypeScript types could be more specific

## Next Sprint Goals

### Sprint 1: Smart Contract Foundation
- [ ] Implement basic session key contract in Cairo
- [ ] Deploy to Starknet testnet
- [ ] Test contract interactions from frontend

### Sprint 2: Session Key Integration
- [ ] Complete @argent/x-sessions integration
- [ ] Implement session creation and validation
- [ ] Add proper error handling

### Sprint 3: Marketplace Logic
- [ ] Implement marketplace smart contract
- [ ] Connect frontend to real contract state
- [ ] Add transaction tracking

## Architecture Notes

### Current Architecture
```
Frontend (Next.js) ‚Üí Starknet.js ‚Üí Wallet ‚Üí Starknet Network
                  ‚Üì
            Mock Data (Hardcoded)
```

### Target Architecture
```
Frontend (Next.js) ‚Üí Starknet.js ‚Üí Wallet ‚Üí Starknet Network
                  ‚Üì                           ‚Üì
            Session Key Contracts ‚Üê‚Üí Marketplace Contract
```

### Key Components
- **Session Key Contract**: Manages session creation, validation, and policies
- **Marketplace Contract**: Handles trading, payments, and escrow
- **Frontend**: User interface for creating, buying, and managing sessions

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow Next.js best practices
- Implement proper error handling
- Add loading states for async operations
- Use consistent naming conventions

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Component tests for React components
- Integration tests for contract interactions
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows

### Security Considerations
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement proper session expiration
- Use secure key encryption
- Add emergency cancellation mechanisms
- Regular security audits
