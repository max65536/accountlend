## Current Issues & Blockers

### Critical Issues
1. ~~**Missing Smart Contracts**: Only placeholder Fibonacci function exists~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Complete Cairo smart contracts implemented
2. **Incomplete Session Integration**: @argent/x-sessions not fully implemented
3. **No Contract Deployment**: No evidence of deployed contracts on Starknet

### Technical Debt
1. **Hardcoded Values**: Mock data instead of blockchain state
2. **Commented Code**: Key functionality disabled in tasksend.tsx
3. **Error Handling**: Limited error handling throughout the app
4. **Type Safety**: Some TypeScript types could be more specific

---

## Next Sprint Goals

### Sprint 1: Smart Contract Foundation
- [ ] Implement basic session key contract in Cairo
- [ ] Deploy to Starknet testnet
- [ ] Test contract interactions from frontend

### Sprint 2: Session Key Integration
- [ ] Complete @argent/x-sessions integration
- [ ] Implement session creation and validation
- [ ] Add proper error handling

### Sprint 3: Marketplace Logic
- [ ] Implement marketplace smart contract
- [ ] Connect frontend to real contract state
- [ ] Add transaction tracking

## Architecture Notes

### Current Architecture
```
Frontend (Next.js) ‚Üí Starknet.js ‚Üí Wallet ‚Üí Starknet Network
                  ‚Üì
            Mock Data (Hardcoded)

            Session Key Contracts ‚Üê‚Üí Marketplace Contract
```

### Key Components
- **Session Key Contract**: Manages session creation, validation, and policies
- **Marketplace Contract**: Handles trading, payments, and escrow
- **Frontend**: User interface for creating, buying, and managing sessions

---

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow Next.js best practices
- Implement proper error handling
- Add loading states for async operations
- Use consistent naming conventions

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Component tests for React components
- Integration tests for contract interactions
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows

### Security Considerations
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement proper session expiration
- Use secure key encryption
- Add emergency cancellation mechanisms
- Regular security audits
