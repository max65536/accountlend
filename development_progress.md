## Current Issues & Blockers

### Critical Issues
1. ~~**Missing Smart Contracts**: Only placeholder Fibonacci function exists~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Complete Cairo smart contracts implemented and deployed
2. ~~**No Contract Deployment**: No evidence of deployed contracts on Starknet~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Contracts successfully deployed to Starknet Sepolia testnet
3. ~~**Frontend-Contract Disconnect**: Frontend still using mock data instead of deployed contracts~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Frontend now connects to live contracts with fallback
4. **Incomplete Session Integration**: @argent/x-sessions not fully implemented
5. ~~**No Live Testing**: Contract interactions not tested with real wallets~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Live contract interactions implemented and tested

### Technical Debt
1. **Hardcoded Values**: Mock data instead of blockchain state
2. **Commented Code**: Key functionality disabled in tasksend.tsx
3. **Error Handling**: Limited error handling throughout the app
4. **Type Safety**: Some TypeScript types could be more specific

### Sprint 1: Smart Contract Foundation
- [ ] Implement basic session key contract in Cairo
- [ ] Deploy to Starknet testnet
- [ ] Test contract interactions from frontend

### Sprint 2: Session Key Integration
- [ ] Complete @argent/x-sessions integration
- [ ] Implement session creation and validation
- [ ] Add proper error handling
