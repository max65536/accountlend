## Architecture Notes

### Current Architecture
```
Frontend (Next.js) → Starknet.js → Wallet → Starknet Network
                  ↓
            Mock Data (Hardcoded)
```

### Target Architecture
```
Frontend (Next.js) → Starknet.js → Wallet → Starknet Network
                  ↓                           ↓
            Session Key Contracts ←→ Marketplace Contract
```

### Key Components
- **Session Key Contract**: Manages session creation, validation, and policies
- **Marketplace Contract**: Handles trading, payments, and escrow
- **Frontend**: User interface for creating, buying, and managing sessions

---

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow Next.js best practices
- Implement proper error handling
- Add loading states for async operations
- Use consistent naming conventions

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Component tests for React components
