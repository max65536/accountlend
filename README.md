This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-starknet`](https://github.com/apibara/starknet-react/tree/main/packages/create-starknet).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Users can set the expire time, limit action(e.g. exclude transfer), of the session key. Once generated the session, users can trade it on the platform. The buyers gain temporary limited control of the seller's account. To avoid the security problem, the seller can cancel the sessionkey at any time and can limit the actions as they want.
